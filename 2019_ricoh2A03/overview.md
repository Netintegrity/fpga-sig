## Background

During Electronics Wednesday 4 Sep 2019, Ryan, Eyal and I had a lengthy discussion
about FPGA programming.

Ryan expressed interest in being able to recreate the audio portion of the Ricoh
2A03 chip used in the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

I've created this project in the hope that it may spur further interest in
FPGA programming at the space.
