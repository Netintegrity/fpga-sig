# Simple As Possible Processors

## Introduction

Digital Computer Electronics by Malvino and Brown provides an excellent
introduction to digital design. It begins with the usual topics of
combinational and sequential logic, however, unlike many other texts, it
then takes a deep dive into processor design.

As someone who has read several texts over the years, I find this an
interesting approach as it provides learning motivation. After all,
what can be a more interesting challenge than building a CPU from the
ground up using basic gates and small scale integration (SSI) parts.

If you've ever wanted to know how a CPU is actually implemented
then this is the book for you.

The book itself is out of print but can be obtained online through the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/367026792DigitalComputerElectronicsAlbertPaulMalvinoAndJeraldABrownPdf1/page/n1/mode/2up). This is the 3rd edition.

## SAP-1

M&B's first processor implementation, SAP-1, provides 5 instructions - load,
add/subtract, output and halt. There are no comparisons, branches or jumps.
A very simple and straight forward task to implement.
