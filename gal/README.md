# FPGA Special Interest Group
Created May 2018
Updated March 2020

Historical records for FPGA development projects at the space.

## Repository Structure
It is anticipated that the FPGA SIG will be a long running group within the space. For this reason the repo is partitioned
with two general ideas. Major projects are prefixed by their inception year. General documentation is nested at the top.

Some of the material stored here is more general, tech tips, techniques etc. These are grouped into their respective
technology platforms gal, cpld etc.

## Project Index
1. 2018_cpu       - RISC processor based on Atmel AVR
2. 2019_ricoh2A03 - Sound effects processor

## Technology Index
1. cpld           - Useful CPLD programming examples
2. gal            - Useful PAL/GAL programming examples
